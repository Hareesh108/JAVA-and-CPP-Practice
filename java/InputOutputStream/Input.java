//        The java.io package contains a large number of classes for reading and writing streams of data, and for interacting with the file system. Some of the more commonly used classes in this package are:
//
//        InputStream and OutputStream: These are abstract classes that define the basic behavior for reading and writing streams of data.
//        FileInputStream and FileOutputStream: These classes are used for reading and writing streams of data to and from files.
//        BufferedReader and BufferedWriter: These classes are used for reading and writing text files, and allow you to read and write lines of text more efficiently by buffering the data.
//                ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream: These classes are used for reading and writing objects to streams, allowing you to save the state of an object and restore it later.
//        There are many other classes in the java.io package as well, including classes for reading and writing data in specific formats (such as CSV or JSON), for working with character sets and encoding,
//        and for interacting with the file system in various ways (such as reading and writing file attributes, or listing the files in a directory).
